# UI/UX Pro Max

This skill provides expert-level UI/UX design assistance, focusing on modern aesthetics, usability, and polished interactions.

## Capabilities

- **Visual Design**: Create stunning interfaces using modern trends like Glassmorphism, Neumorphism, Brutalism, or Minimalist design.
- **UX Optimization**: Improve user flows, information architecture, and interaction feedback.
- **Code Implementation**: Provide production-ready CSS (Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components, WXSS) and markup (HTML, JSX, WXML).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure designs are accessible (contrast, sizing, screen reader support).
- **Responsive Design**: Guarantee layouts work perfectly across all device sizes.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Asks to "make it look better" or "beautify" the interface.
- Requests a specific design style (e.g., "modern", "clean", "futuristic").
- Needs help with CSS layout, animations, or transitions.
- Wants to improve the user experience or flow of the application.
- Complains about the current UI being "ugly" or "hard to use".

## Best Practices

1.  **Modern Defaults**: Default to modern design principles (generous whitespace, consistent typography, subtle shadows, rounded corners).
2.  **Platform Awareness**: Adapt designs to the target platform (e.g., WeChat Mini Program constraints, Web standards, Mobile-first).
3.  **Interactive Feedback**: Always suggest active/hover states, loading skeletons, and error states.
4.  **Color Theory**: Use harmonious color palettes. Suggest using CSS variables for theming.

## Example Instructions

- "Redesign this login page to look like a modern glassmorphism card."
- "Optimize the checkout flow to reduce friction."
- "Add micro-interactions to these buttons."
